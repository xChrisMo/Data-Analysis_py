# Exploratory Data Wrangling

## Project Overview

This project is a wrangling exercise as of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree final project. It involved merging two different datasets of different file sources(scrapped for csv for first, and then used API for the other) with very little relation, finding relations, feature engineering them to provide insights, answer questions each cant individually answer.

## Program Structure

The internship is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Accenture's work:

1. **Project Gathering**
2. **Data Accessing**
3. **Data Cleaning**
4. **Data Loading**
5. **Finding Insights**


## Libraries Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For creating static visualizations
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization

## Files in the Repository
- `Ayo_Data_Wrangling.html`: HTML version of full wranlging script
- `Ayo_Data_Wrangling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook of wrangling
- `beautifulsoupscrape.csv`: BeautifulSoup scrape for page holding first dataset
- `apijsonscrape.csv`: Scraping script for JSON extracting from API
- `mergeddatasets.csv`: Loaded data after extracting, wrangling and combining data


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed
3. Open the `Ayo_Data_Wrangling.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or your preferred environment
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis
